Exercice 3 - UX Design (approx. 1h30)

At BuzzHire we collect and value feedbacks from our users after each job is completed.

The data we collect include:

The global rating the user gives to the other party (clients rate freelancers, and freelancer rate clients)
Specific rating per criteria (criteria A, criteria B, criteria C, criteria D)
Any additional comment they may have (free text)
Report of the time the job actually start and finished (late, extra hours, etc), prepopulated with the original times.
TODO

TASK : Design and prototype an interface so the users can leave these feedbacks with ease using their desktop browser

You must maximize the percentage of users leaving ratings, and find ux tricks to do so (hide fields when relevant, use tags, etc) ;
Wording and design are totally up to you, it can match our brand or just native OS components ;
The result can be on any support/tools of your choice. Explanations are appreciated if relevant.
If you have time, feel free to improve your interface and add more features :

Possibility to leave bulk feedbacks (for example using a list) within few taps / clicks
Create an UI for mobile (app or mobile website)
Implement the interface in HTML / make it dynamic (e.g. using invision)
etc.
